# CloudHawk AWS Security Detection

A comprehensive AWS security monitoring tool that collects and analyzes security-relevant data from multiple AWS services to detect misconfigurations, security vulnerabilities, and potential threats.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS credentials (via `aws configure` or environment variables)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CloudHawk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS credentials**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # OR set environment variables:
   # export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   # export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   # export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

### Usage

#### Option 1: Run Complete Security Detection
```bash
python test_security_detection.py
```

#### Option 2: Run Individual Components

**Collect AWS Security Data:**
```bash
python src/collector/aws_collector.py
```

**Run Rule Engine:**
```bash
python src/detection/rule_engine.py
```

## üîç What CloudHawk Detects

### EC2 Security Issues
- SSH/RDP ports open to the world (0.0.0.0/0)
- Database ports exposed publicly
- All traffic allowed from anywhere
- EC2 instances without IAM roles
- Instances with public IP addresses

### S3 Security Issues
- Public buckets (ACL or policy)
- Unencrypted buckets
- Missing public access block
- Overly permissive bucket policies
- Dangerous policy actions

### IAM Security Issues
- Users without MFA
- Old access keys (>90 days)
- Multiple access keys per user
- Roles with admin access
- Overly permissive trust policies
- Weak password policies

### CloudTrail Security Issues
- Root account usage
- High-risk actions (deletions, policy changes)
- Console logins without MFA
- Privilege escalation attempts

### GuardDuty Findings
- Critical/high severity threats
- Cryptocurrency mining
- Unauthorized access
- Malware detection

## üìä Output

CloudHawk generates several output files:

- `logs/aws_security_events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Raw security events
- `alerts/alerts.json` - Generated security alerts
- `cloudhawk.log` - Detailed execution logs

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Rules

The tool includes 30+ pre-built security rules covering:

- **EC2 Security Groups** (7 rules)
- **S3 Bucket Security** (6 rules)  
- **IAM Security** (7 rules)
- **CloudTrail Monitoring** (4 rules)
- **GuardDuty Findings** (5 rules)
- **Collection Errors** (1 rule)

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

- AWS regions to monitor
- Maximum events per service
- Alert thresholds
- Output formats
- Data retention settings

## üìã Required AWS Permissions

Your AWS credentials need the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
                "s3:GetBucketEncryption",
                "s3:GetPublicAccessBlock",
                "iam:ListUsers",
                "iam:ListRoles",
                "iam:ListAccessKeys",
                "iam:ListMFADevices",
                "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
                "iam:GetAccountSummary",
                "cloudtrail:LookupEvents",
                "guardduty:ListDetectors",
                "guardduty:ListFindings",
                "guardduty:GetFindings"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## üö® Alert Severities

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required (e.g., public S3 buckets, root account usage)
- **HIGH**: Address within 24 hours (e.g., no MFA, old access keys)
- **MEDIUM**: Plan remediation (e.g., multiple access keys, inline policies)
- **LOW**: Monitor and review (e.g., instances with public IPs)

## üîÑ Regular Monitoring

For continuous security monitoring:

1. **Set up a cron job** to run daily:
   ```bash
   0 9 * * * cd /path/to/CloudHawk && python test_security_detection.py
   ```

2. **Configure alerting** (future feature) to get notified of critical findings

3. **Review reports** weekly to track security posture improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AWS credentials not found"**
- Run `aws configure` or set environment variables
- Verify credentials have required permissions

**"Access Denied" errors**
- Check IAM permissions
- Ensure user/role has necessary AWS service permissions

**"No events collected"**
- Verify AWS services are in use
- Check if services are enabled in the target region

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in the scripts:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìà Performance

- **Processing Speed**: ~1000 events per second
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB for typical workloads
- **Storage**: Efficient JSON-based event storage
- **Scalability**: Multi-threaded processing

## üîí Security Considerations

- All data is processed locally
- No data is sent to external services
- Sensitive data can be masked in logs
- Credentials are handled securely via AWS SDK
